# Exception Handling in Flutter

## Introduction

Exception handling is the process of responding to unexpected events or errors that occur during the execution of a program. In Flutter, exceptions can be thrown when runtime errors occur, such as null pointer exceptions, type errors, or network errors.

## Try-Catch Block

The try-catch block in Flutter is used to handle exceptions by enclosing the code that may throw an exception within a try block and providing a catch block to handle the exception if it occurs. The catch block specifies the type of exception it can handle.

## Finally Block

The finally block in Flutter is used to execute code that should always run, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught. It is often used to perform cleanup operations, such as closing files or releasing resources.

## On Clause

The on clause in Flutter is used to catch specific types of exceptions. It allows you to specify the type of exception that should be caught by the catch block. This provides more granular control over exception handling.

## Rethrowing Exceptions

Rethrowing exceptions in Flutter allows you to catch an exception, perform some operations, and then rethrow the exception to be handled by a higher-level catch block. This can be useful for logging or adding additional context to the exception.

## Custom Exceptions

In addition to built-in exceptions, Flutter allows you to define custom exceptions by extending the Exception class or any of its subclasses. Custom exceptions can be used to handle specific errors or to provide more meaningful error messages to users.

## Asynchronous Exception Handling

Asynchronous exception handling in Flutter allows you to handle exceptions that occur in asynchronous code, such as asynchronous functions or futures. It uses the try-catch block or the catchError method to handle exceptions thrown by asynchronous operations.

This README provides an overview of exception handling in Flutter, covering try-catch blocks, finally blocks, on clauses, rethrowing exceptions, custom exceptions, and asynchronous exception handling.
